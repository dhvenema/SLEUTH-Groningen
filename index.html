    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As urbanization occurs, cities and villages expand outwards claiming new areas. This process exerts high pressure on the open and natural environment and signifies the importance of urban management and development. However, the driving forces and effects associated with urbanization affect various disciplines, and temporal and spatial scales, which makes understanding and describing them and their interrelations a complex issue (Goldstein, et al. 2004). An urban model could function as a planning support system to obtain said knowledge, because it enables the simplification of urban complexity and allows to combine several disciplines in a multi-disciplinary approach. For studying the urban environment, cellular automata has become a popular and successful modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate the urban complexity.</p>
