    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As urbanization occurs, cities and villages expand outwards claiming new areas. This process exerts high pressure on
      the open and natural environment and signifies the importance of urban management and development. However, the driving
      forces and effects associated with urbanization affect various disciplines, and temporal and spatial scales, which
      makes understanding and describing them and their interrelations a complex issue (Goldstein, et al. 2004). An urban
      model could function as a planning support system to obtain said knowledge, because it enables the simplification of
      urban complexity and allows to combine several disciplines in a multi-disciplinary approach. For studying the urban
      environment, cellular automata has become a popular and successful modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate
      the urban complexity.</p>
    <p>This master’s thesis was aimed at studying the urban growth patterns in Groningen by applying a planning support system,
      namely the cellular automaton SLEUTH. The main objective of this research was to calibrate and validate SLEUTH to fit
      Groningen’s context in an attempt to predict the future land cover change of Groningen up to 2045. It did this with
      an integrated application of: Geographical Information Systems, remote sensing, and a multicriteria evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>The cellular automata method is underpinned by Complexity Theory. A theory that does not have a precise definition, instead,
      it is described by characteristics, such as self-organizing, dynamical, chaotic and critical nature, non-linearity,
      emergence and self-similarity. These characteristics are derived from other paradigms that reach back to the 19th century,
      such as Cerdá’s Theory on Urbanización and Geddes’ Evolutionary Paradigm and Emergence, and other paradigms that have
      roots in physics and mathematics, such as The General Systems Theory, Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. Wolfram (1984b)
      showed that the characteristics of these paradigms and theories exist in cellular automata, and cellular automatons
      were able to capture complex emerging structures based on simple mathematical rules. Couclelis (1985; 1989) developed
      the first theoretical approaches for the spatial application of cellular automata to cities. After which, Itami (1994)
      theorized that if cellular automata is applied to a lattice, it could also be integrated into Geographical Information
      Systems to facilitate visualization and interpretation of the simulation results. Then in the 1990s, the first urban
      cellular automatons were developed by Batty and Xie (1994), White et al. (1997) and Clarke et al. (1997).</p>
    <p>In this master’s thesis an overview was presented of fundamental principles of urban modelling, after which two modelling
      methods were elaborated: agent-based modelling and cellular automata. Five urban models are discussed that can simulate
      land cover change (UrbanSim, Metronamica, Dinamica EGO, CLUE and SLEUTH), thereafter the SLEUTH model is adopted for
      this research and explained in detail. The urban extent input data was derived from a land use classification by object-based
      remote sensing. In addition, the excluded layer is an important input data layer of SLEUTH, as it plays a key role
      in accommodating for the dispersed urban growth patterns in Groningen. For this study, the excluded layer was an urbanization-suitability
      layer through a multicriteria evaluation, wherein factors were standardized through fuzzy set theory and weighted by
      analytical hierarchy process.</p>
    <p>Further, calibration and validation are essential parts of predictive modelling and become even more important when models
      are used as planning support systems. Often the schism between these parts is poorly defined (Pontius, et al., 2004).
      In light of this critique, the validation procedure for his research was separated through time, where the input data
      from 1973 up to 2006 was part of model calibration through the use of a regular ‘Brute-Force’ calibration with the
      Optimal SLEUTH metric (Silva & Clarke, 2002), and the urban area and patterns of 2006 up to 2015 was predicted, which
      were used for model validation by three-map comparison (Pontius, et al., 2008), budgets of components of agreement
      and disagreement, and multiple resolution comparison (Pontius, et al., 2011; Pontius, et al., 2004).</p>
    <p>The modelling results of calibration showed that based on the goodness of fit measures that E0 performed below acceptable,
      which is the regular excluded layer only incorporating constraints. E1 should be considered a questionable result,
      which is the excluded layer based on a multicriteria evaluation. E2 and E3 achieved sufficient fit, which are the excluded
      layers based on a multicriteria evaluation that includes the policies of respectively, 1971 and 1978. Validation showed
      that for none of the excluded layers, the amount correctly predicted change was larger than the sum of the various
      types of error, i.e. a figure of merit of 50%. In fact, the highest overall figure of merit was only 25%, showing SLEUTH
      had difficulties in accurately simulating under these circumstances. Further, validation showed that all excluded layers
      achieved higher fit-score than their random counterpart, yet none were able to achieve higher fit-scores than the null
      map at the finest resolution (i.e. 30 m). Which suggest that having a map of 2006 is a better predictor of the urban
      growth patterns in 2015 than any of the excluded layers at the finest resolution. Notwithstanding, allocation disagreement
      resolved at coarser resolutions and at a resolution of 16 or 32 times the cell side, E2 and E3 were more accurate than
      the null map and the random map, and achieved a figure of merit up to 30%. This suggests that SLEUTH is able to provide
      good expression of neighborhood relationship at coarser scales. In addition, based on validation and compared to the
      FOM of other applications (Pontius, et al., 2008), E2 and E3 could be classified as reasonably accurate, E0 had a low
      accuracy and E1 had mediocre accuracy at best. Further in-depth analysis showed that SLEUTH lacks mechanism that were
      found important to the study area. For example, the study area could benefit from a multi-scale or multi-resolution
      approach, and the inclusion of models that could forecast regional demands regarding real-estate and changes in demographics,
      to account for regional differences.</p>
    <p>Concluding, to answer to the main research question, none of the excluded layers were capable of capturing the dispersed
      urban growth patterns in the study area during simulation or prediction. Hence, the assumption was made that the scenarios
      used for predicting, would also not be able to produce accurate urban growth patterns, as these are based on the same
      principles as used in the excluded layers. Despite, the integrated application of Geographical Information Systems,
      remote sensing, a multicriteria evaluation for urban suitability and SLEUTH, did show (much) higher goodness of fit
      and (much) higher accuracy for the excluded layers that incorporated an urbanization-suitability layer based on an
      multicriteria evaluation, as compared to the excluded layer that did not. Thus, SLEUTH’s excluded layer could be further
      tested and improved to fit Groningen’s context, SLEUTH could be coupled with complementary methods to include demographics
      or socio-economic variables, or a different urban model could be used that includes more sophisticated mechanics.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The concentration of population in urban areas and the subsequent urbanization are world-wide phenomena. The various
      effects of urbanization have been studied since the 19th century and were often considered a problem that could be,
      and should be, controlled via planning and policies. This kind of approach has its roots in physicalism, a concept
      that urban problems could be solved by shaping the physical urban environment (Batty & Marshall, 2009). Ever since
      the 19th century, with the rise of Urbanism as a science (Soria y Puig, 1999), planning and policies aimed at manipulating
      the physical environment were seen as the solution to controlling the effects caused by urban growth. However, as urbanization
      is of great complexity, affecting the urban structure at multiple spatial and temporal scales, the effects of policies
      and urban plans regularly had unforeseen consequence (Batty, 2014). Controlling the city, its effects, problems and
      inhabitants was not that straightforward.</p>
    <p>At the end of the 1940s the digital computer appeared, which allowed rapid and large-scale numerical processing. This
      new technology enabled researchers to operationalize their mathematical theories on spatial systems via urban modelling
      in an attempt to unravel the urban complexity (Hall, 1996). Consequently, this led to a diverse array of quantitative
      simulation models that attempted to explore urban growth patterns. A drawback of these spatial models was that they
      were complicated and heavy-engineering based rather than theory, and failed to capture the urban complexity (Batty,
      1976). In the 1980s, the field of spatial modelling was revived by, amongst others, Wolfram (1984b) who showed that
      simple rules in cellular automata (CA) could replicate complex, emerging structures and patterns found in nature, and
      Couclelis (1985; 1989) who developed the first theoretical approaches for the spatial application of CA to cities.
      Subsequently, during the last three decades the field of urban modelling evolved rapidly and provided new tools to
      understand the drivers of change behind urban dynamics. For studying urban dynamics, CA has become a popular and successful
      modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate complexity. Moreover, as CA is in itself spatial and is applied
      to a grid of geographical data, it can be integrated in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to facilitate analysis,
      visualization and interpretation of the modelling results (White, Engelen, & Uljee, 1997; Itami, 1994; Batty & Xie,
      1994).
    </p>
    <section id="11-problem-definition">
      <h3>1.1 Problem Definition</h3>
      <p>Over half of the world population lives in urbanized areas and the number of city dwellers is expected to rise in the
        coming years (UN, 2014). Generally, the Netherlands is conceived as one of the most densely urbanized areas in the
        world, and whilst this is true, Dutch cities are relatively small and urban development is dispersed (Broitman &
        Koomen, 2015). Nonetheless, as urbanization occurs, cities and villages expand outwards claiming new areas. This
        process exerts high pressure on the open and natural environment and signifies the importance of urban management
        and development. Therefore, during the last 70 years the Dutch planning concept was to anticipate urban growth and
        minimize the spatial footprint of the city and preserve the natural environment (Faludi & van der Valk, 1994; Zonneveld,
        1991). As early as 1972, the city of Groningen has attempted to deal with this urban complexity via the compact city
        policy, a policy that the city of Groningen continues to operationalize (Schroor, 2009).</p>
      <p>However, the driving forces and effects associated with urbanization affect various disciplines, and temporal and spatial
        scales, which makes understanding and describing them and their interrelations a complex issue. This knowledge is
        required to support local urban planners and decision-makers to evaluate the consequences of their planning policies
        (Koomen, Rietveld, & de Nijs, 2008). An urban model could function as a planning support system to obtain said knowledge,
        because it enables the simplification of urban complexity and allows to combine several disciplines in a multi-disciplinary
        approach (Goldstein, Candau, & Clarke, 2004). They allow the study of interaction between individual entities at
        a lower level that result in patterns at a higher level. This is useful in urban planning, where the construction
        of a society by individuals also influences the human activities of society. Through the use of simulations and scenarios,
        valuable insight into future urban dynamics could be provided to local urban planners and decision-makers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="12-scope-of-the-research">
      <h3>1.2 Scope of the research</h3>
      <p>This master’s thesis is an exploratory research that studies the evolution of urban growth and urban patterns of the
        Groningen region, from here on referred to as Groningen, over different time scales through computer simulations.
        It does so by applying an urban model to the Dutch context. However, it does not try to build its own urban model,
        rather, it will be using an existing model that has been frequently applied throughout the world, namely the self-modifying
        CA SLEUTH (Clarke, Hoppen, & Gaydos, 1997) and the improved version SLEUTH-3r (Jantz, Goetz, Donato, & Clagget, 2010),
        referred to as SLEUTH unless specifically discussing SLEUTH-3r. This research focusses on the core of the compact
        city policy, which is minimizing the spatial footprint of the city (Zonneveld, 1991) and urban land cover change.
        An overview of what is believed to be a relevant theoretical background with regard to CA and urban modelling will
        be presented, without explicitly attempting to expand underlying theories of complexity or urbanization. Instead,
        this study is a practical research concerned with land cover changes, with an integrated application of: GIS, remote
        sensing (RS), multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and an urban growth model (UGM). In that effort, it does not study the
        correctness of planning policies that have been applied by Groningen in the past, but it attempts to examine the
        dynamic outcomes of urbanization to support local urban planners and decision-makers. Also, it does not explicitly
        attempt to allocate urban development that could cope with future human activities or growth, since an urban model
        will only provide a rough possible indication of land cover change (Timmermans, 2003).</p>
      <p>Therefore, the scope of the research is limited to testing its hypotheses that: (a) it is possible to calibrate a UGM
        to Groningen’s context by combining separate tools (i.e. GIS, RS, MCE and UGM) and forecast future urban dynamics
        under different planning scenarios that fit into the context of Groningen, and (b) that other relevant factors that
        influence the urban development in Groningen could be incorporated in the UGM with an urbanization-suitability layer
        based on an MCE.</p>
      <p>Major advantages of the modelling and simulation approaches adopted by this research are that: the simulation will
        be based on accurate satellite imagery data by RS, which will reveal the history of urban expansion; the MCE will
        be able to include more driving forces of urban development that can be integrated into the UGM; and this type of
        modelling will help in exploring the future urban dynamics through scenarios. Drawbacks of this type of approach
        are that through the use of RS and MCE, data acquisition will be time-consuming and only a static temporal and spatial
        change between defined intervals will be recorded. This emphasizes the difficulties in conducting a temporal sensitivity
        analysis on the simulation results and the difficulties in underpinning the growth process in the study area.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="13-research-aims-and-objectives">
      <h3>1.3 Research aims and objectives</h3>
      <p>The aim of this master’s thesis is to contribute to the understanding of CA and urban modelling as planning support
        systems. It attempts to review relevant theories on complexity and to obtain an empirics-based understanding of said
        theory by applying a CA. Therefore, the main research objectives are:
        <ul>
          <li>calibrating and validating a UGM to suit Groningen’s context;</li>
          <li>simulating and understanding the urban growth patterns produced by the calibration phase;</li>
          <li>and predicting the future urban dynamics, spatially and temporally, using Groningen.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Accordingly, this leads to the following research question: “What will be the land cover change of Groningen in 2045
        as compared to 2015 based on three different scenarios, to explore Groningen’s future urban dynamics?”</p>
      <p>Additional research aims are to apply SLEUTH to a dispersed urban area that is relatively small with a slow absolute
        urban growth as compared to study areas SLEUTH is commonly applied to (García, Santé, Boullón, & Crecente, 2012).
        Due to the dispersed character, the area contains a variety of villages and cities of different sizes that all experienced
        different types of urban growth and show different urban patterns. In that regard, an urbanization-suitability layer
        would be key to differentiate the various types of urban growth and to capture the growth pattern with an UGM. Furthermore,
        this research assesses the feasibility of applying SLEUTH to a city with a clear spatial policy to remain compact
        and minimize urban growth. Generally, the Netherlands has a long tradition of urban planning and since the Second
        World War, urban planning has always had a strong influence on urban growth. Hence, incorporating policy maps into
        an urbanization-suitability layer may be desirable in order to accurately model historic and predict future urban
        dynamics. Although, guiding or masking the model input with policy maps into favoring more likely outcomes, could
        bias the modelling procedure in to better calibration and forecasting results (Akın, Clarke, & Berberoglu, 2014;
        Pontius, Huffaker, & Denman, 2004). This leads to the question: at what point is the model guided or biased too much
        by policies and masking? Accordingly, both additional research goals express the importance of calibrating an UGM
        to fit Groningen’s context.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="14-relevance">
      <h3>1.4 Relevance</h3>
      <p>The societal relevance comes from the analysis of spatial expansion patterns and land use changes that could provide
        insight into future urban dynamics of Groningen, which is of great importance for local urban planners and decision-makers.
        A CA as a planning support system is a useful tool that could visualize the historical growth patterns and alternative
        futures that are researched, which helps in exploring and understanding future urban dynamics.</p>
      <p>The scientific relevance is found in: (a) most examples found in literature apply SLEUTH to rapidly growing, large
        urban areas, where it is relatively easy to make generalizations and extrapolate processes than in slower growing
        areas (García, et al., 2012). Whilst Groningen is the second fastest growing city in the Netherlands, it is different
        from other areas that have been researched with SLEUTH, since it is a much smaller urban area and has not experienced
        same urban sprawl due to the more modest absolute growth rates and the compact city policies that have been applied
        to Groningen (Schroor, 2009). (b) Initially SLEUTH had been primarily applied to North-American cities and the application
        to cities outside of North-American was questioned. However, the last few years this has expanded rapidly to Chinese,
        Middle-Eastern and European cities. Results have shown that SLEUTH is able to identify local characteristics and
        predict future urban land change correctly across the globe (Chaudhuri & Clarke, 2013b). As local characteristics
        are often more similar in nearby regions and delineated by country borders, it would be useful to apply SLEUTH to
        the Dutch context. Consequently, this could help assess the feasibility of applying SLEUTH to the Netherlands.</p>

    <section id="15-research-methodology">
      <h3>1.5 Research methodology</h3>
      <p>The following section operationalizes the research statement as outlined above. This research consists of a theoretical
        approach and a practical approach (<a href="#figure-01">Figure 1</a>). The theoretical approach adopts the literature
        review as a method to research Complexity Theory, urbanization and CA. The practical approach consists of a quantitative,
        empirical research using a computer simulation to gain insight in land cover changes between 2015 and 2045 based
        on historic data from 1973 to 2015 for Groningen. Afterwards, the future urban dynamics are explored through scenarios.
        The research design consists of the following methods: (a) a literature research trough literature review, and (b)
        a case study using SLEUTH.
      </p>
      <p>The research methods applied in the practical approach will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 3 since the SLEUTH
        framework requires a considerable amount of pre-processing and when setting up a new application. During the practical
        research, special attention will be paid to the three phases of the modelling efforts: data acquisition, calibration
        and validation phases. Ensuring the quality of the input data is one of the most important elements of model calibration
        (Silva & Clarke, 2002). Therefore, data acquisition and data transformation are key to understanding errors and uncertainties
        in the input data and a crucial component for a successful simulation and interpretation of results (Yeh & Li, 2006).
        Similarly, the calibration phase is important, if not the most critical portion of the modelling effort. It is during
        this phase that an estimate of the parameter values, which describe an urban system, are determined, and upon which
        all forecasting and scenario simulation is based (Batty, 1976). Validation is an essential part of predictive modelling
        when models are used as planning support systems, especially since model validation is often poorly defined or even
        neglected (Pontius, et al., 2004; Pontius, Peethambaram, & Castella, 2011).</p>

      <p>This master’s thesis is divided into six chapters. The <a href="#2-theoretical-background">second chapter</a> adopts
        a theoretical approach that aims at discussing the theoretical background of urbanization and urban modelling in
        an historical context. It focusses on Complexity Theory and various related theories such as: urbanization, the evolutionary
        paradigm, the General System Theory, emergence, Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. All of these theories include
        some of the most important characteristics that lay the foundations of Complexity Theory and CA. From there on, more
        is explained on the origin and general structure of spatial models and in particular CA. The next section provides
        an overview and brief explanation of spatial models that are currently available and commonly used for the simulation
        of urban dynamics. Lastly, the chapter end with concluding notes and explaining why SLEUTH was chosen for this study.</p>
      <p>The third chapter will explain the research methodology in more detail. Initially, the delineation of the study area
        is shown and a brief historic overview of the study area is given. Afterwards, methods used in this study are discussed
        as well as the various scales that they are applied to. The next section of the chapter focus on the calibration,
        based on a SLEUTH-specific calibration procedure. The subsequent validation of SLEUTH is discussed in the following
        section. Both are discussed in detail, emphasizing the fact that these two processes are crucial to a successful
        modelling result and to properly define them as two separate phases during urban modelling. The next section explains
        the prediction procedure as conducted in this study and the three scenarios that were used in prediction. Lastly,
        the chapter end with concluding notes and a brief overview of the third chapter.</p>
      <p>The following chapter elaborates on the data pre-processing that was done during this study. This includes the pre-processing
        of satellite data via RS, the input data for SLEUTH and the various input layers that were needed for an urbanization-suitability
        layer based on an MCE, to implement in the excluded layer of SLEUTH. The chapter focusses on explaining how the input
        data was pre-processed and why certain decisions were made, in order to determine the accuracy of the input data,
        so the subsequent validation could properly assess the accuracy of the modelling results.</p>
      <p>The fifth chapter will present the calibration, validation and prediction results based on the application of SLEUTH.
        Lastly, the final chapter will discuss the conclusion based on the whole research and specifically the application
        of SLEUTH to Groningen.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Complexity Theory</h3>
      <p>CA has become a popular modelling method to understand urban land use change due to its simplicity to replicate emerging
        and complex patterns. To give meaning to the term CA, the underlying principle of complexity will be discussed. Complexity
        is a theory that consists of diverse concepts reaching all the way back to the 19th century. Therefore, some relevant
        concepts and theories will be elaborated: urbanización, the evolutionary paradigm, the General Systems Theory, emergence,
        Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. The theories and paradigms that will be briefly discussed are merely a portion
        of the literature that is the basis of Complexity Theory. However, these function as a scope to view Complexity Theory
        to provide some insight in the origins of CA.</p>
      <section id="urbanizacion">
        <h4>Urbanización</h4>
        <p>The concentration of population in urban areas and the subsequent urban growth are world-wide phenomena. These phenomena
          have its origins in a time in transition: a transition from a rural to urban society, driven by the industrial
          revolution. The zeitgeist of this period is portrayed by on one side the fascination of the metropolitan society
          as described by Simmel (1903). To him the city was an opportunity, one filled with uncertainty, marking the schism
          between a rural and urban society. It was a place producing conditions that liberated the metropolitan man, as
          well as overstimulate his senses. This was unfathomable to those living in the country and is what separated the
          city dweller from his fellow man (Simmel, 1903). The city was a place of luxury, watching and being watched, with
          a distant yet intensely social-cultural atmosphere (Benjamin, 1935).</p>
        <p>On the other side there was the rejection of the metropolis, a grim image of the sporadically ever-growing “monster
          Leviathan, stretching acre upon acre into the far distance”, as Wright (1901) so eloquently phrased in his piece:
          “The Art and Craft of the Machine”. “Be gently lifted at nightfall to the top of a great down-town office building,
          and you may see how in the image of material man, at once his glory and menace, is this thing we call a city” (p.
          68). This rejection of the city led to the ‘Garden City’ concept by Howard (1902), who showed a similar distaste
          of the city. “I am always haunted by the awfulness of London: by the great appalling fact of these millions cast
          down, as it would appear by hazard, on the banks of this noble stream, working each in their own groove and their
          own cell, without regard or knowledge of each other” (p. 10). Both Howard and Wright were concerned with the well-being
          of the city dwellers and saw the negative social and health effects cities had on its inhabitants that were most
          acute in large cities. Therefore, both developed their utopian antithesis of the industrial city, their antidote
          to the greatest danger of modern existence.</p>
        <p>The idea that urban growth was a monstrous, uncontrollable growth dominated the origins of urban planning. The growth
          and various problems a city produced were considered a problem that could be, and should be, controlled via planning
          and policies. This kind of approach has its roots in physicalism, a concept that is based on the idea that urban
          problems could be solved, and the behavior of the masses could be controlled by shaping the physical urban environment
          (Batty & Marshall, 2009).</p>
        <p>Ever since the 19th century, as a reaction to the urban chaos unraveled by the industrial revolution, centralized
          planning and policies were seen as the solution to controlling the effects caused by urban growth. Exemplar to
          the paradigm of physicalism were Haussmann and Cerdá, who both lived in an era where it became important to perform
          some sort of control over the rapidly growing industrial cities. Between 1852 and 1870, Haussmann was one of the
          first to attempt this on a large scale by modernizing Paris. His goal was to solve the problems of overcrowding,
          crime, traffic circulation and the spreading of diseases. He attempted to do this by controlling the city via creating
          a whole circulatory and respiratory system that would turn the city into an operative whole. Similarly, in 1860
          Cerdá attempted to improve the living conditions and infrastructural circulation in Barcelona via his top-down
          urban expansion plans. However, as urban areas are structures of great complexity, the effects of policies and
          urban plans regularly had unforeseen consequences. Controlling the city, its effects, problems and inhabitants
          was not that straightforward.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, with the advances of modern civilization, Cerdá predicted that the construction of cities would
          become a true science. He foresaw the coming of the new science of urbanism and developed the concept of
          <em>urbanización</em> in ‘Teoría General de la Urbanización’ in 1876. He understood that the industrial revolution
          and “the harnessing of steam as a driving force had signaled the end of an era for humanity and the beginning of
          another” (Soria y Puig, 1999, p. 54). With the birth of new infrastructures such as telecommunications, sewage
          systems and railroads, he foresaw a civilization of movement and communication. A dynamic place where time is counted
          in seconds and distance in myriametres (i.e. 10 kilometers). He developed an integrated approach to urbanism as
          “today everything is movement, everything is expansion, everything is communicativeness” (Soria y Puig, 1999, p.
          57) and proposed a radical theory that the infrastructure and especially the <em>circulacíon</em>, were fundamental
          to urbanization. Prior to Cerdá circulation, was used as an analytical framework to do calculations and explain
          or describe the current state. However, Cerdá envisioned circulacíon being the theoretical grounds on which the
          current state could be transformed in service of a mobile and alterable urban area and society (Adams, 2014).</p>
        <p>“Today, everything that matters circulates. Circulation is the central activity through which value is made visible.
          It is the concrete register of progress. For this reason, infrastructure now appears as the default apparatus by
          which such a global society mediates its needs. It is the source of our problems as well as the diagram for their
          solutions” (Adams, 2014, p.13).</p>
        <p>The question now was, what should Cerdá name this dynamic place? He introduced a new word: <em>urbe</em>. A term
          closely related to ‘city’, but as Cerdá explains: the difference being that the urban area (urbe) presupposes the
          city, it disregards the administrative boundaries that confine a city (<em>ciudad</em>). The urbe included townships
          and hamlets in the periphery, the towns and villages closer to the center, and in the very center, the urban core.
          These three things, distinct from each other, genuinely form what should be called an urbe (Soria y Puig, 1999).
          With the term urbe, Cerdá wanted to address the dynamic character of the urban area wherein infrastructure is the
          physical appearance of circulation, unbounded by borders. It allowed circulation to flow unobstructed and glue
          all facets and nodes of the urban area together. Cerdá named this infrastructure: <em>vialidad</em>. With this
          theory he recognized the urbe, with the fundaments of vialadid and circulacíon, as a complex process relying on
          five bases: technical, political, economic, legal and administrative. These bases were interrelated and to understand
          them, one would have to study circulacíon, vialidad and the urbe with statistical studies, what Cerdá called an
          “encyclopedic approach”. Subsequently, bearing all five bases in mind whilst developing an expansion plan for an
          urbe would yield the highest result, a harmony between “the independence of the family and the enjoyment of sociability”
          (Soria y Puig, 1999, pp. 64-66).</p>

      <section id="evolutionary-paradigm">
        <h4>Evolutionary Paradigm</h4>
        <p>During that same period, the image of the city as a machine was replaced by that of an organism. The city was often
          analogous to an organism, such as Howard (1902), who compared settlements to organisms and Burgess (1924), who
          compared urban growth to the anabolic and catabolic states of the metabolism. Both these analogues have their roots
          in the evolutionary paradigm, which was underpinned by the work of Geddes (1915). He conceived the city as something
          organic that would evolve in relation to its environment. “The environment acts, through function, upon the organism
          and conversely the organism acts, through function, upon the environment” and the “…environment, function and organism
          are thus no longer viewed apart, but as the elements of a single process…” (Geddes, 1915, p. 198). His work drew
          loosely upon the Theory of Evolution by Darwin, but emphasized the importance of the cooperation of the individual
          cells to survive competition. His comparison to evolution implied there is a fixed relation between the parts and
          the whole of the organism, but since evolution is open-ended and unpredictable, cities would not have an end-state.
          This is in contrast to traditional city planners such as Haussmann and Cerdá, who endeavored the optima forma of
          cities by the implementation of their plans.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Geddes speaks of Greater London that is exceeding its physical boundaries and is uniting neighboring
          villages and cities. He states that the governmental and administrative boundaries are constantly being outgrown.
          This growth process demanded a new civic statesmanship. “Constellations we cannot call them; conglomerations is,
          alas! nearer the mark at present, but it may sound unappreciative; what of Conurbations?” (Geddes, 1915, p. 34).
          Geddes envisioned a city-region that would function as a whole, an organism flourishing through cooperation, thus
          the city would only be as good as its city-region. A few decades earlier, that same point was made by Cerdá, when
          he coined the term urbe. Nonetheless, the term conurbation was picked up by Fawcett (1922) and officially adopted
          by the United Kingdom. Fawcett changed the definition of the term conurbation slightly, to an area occupied by
          a continuous series of dwellings, factories and other buildings, which are not separated from each other by rural
          land, or what he called the “brick-and-mortar unity”. However, it is important to note that both authors saw the
          region strictly as a physical phenomenon (Hall, 1996).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Geddes’ ideas of the evolutionary paradigm were to some extent misinterpreted. For example, Mumford
          (1938) tried to extend the organic analogue by arguing that since organisms have a definite boundary and maximum
          size, so should a city. “Like an organism, cities much achieve stability and continuity …if they are to perform
          their high function as the cradle and focus of man’s creative activities” (Chapman & Fenyon, 1963). Subsequently,
          the concentration of activity would undermine its benefits, leading to a formless urban tissue spreading randomly
          across the countryside, bringing chaos and congestion. Instead, he emphasized stability. Therefore, the limitations
          on size, density and area were necessary and the most important instruments of civic planning. Cities would have
          to be understood as a city-region, wherein the city could only thrive if all parts would cooperate (Mumford, 1938).
          This kind of thinking fell in line with the traditional top-down planning approach, wherein the planner knew the
          intended optima forma of a city and could apply this via his designs.</p>
        <p>There was a view that Geddes shared with Cerdá, which was the statistical vision they had of the city. The both believed
          one would have to understand and diagnose the urban landscape through statistical studies before attempting to
          treat its problems, “survey before plan” (Geddes, 1915). Conversely, Sitte (1889) spoke out against this statistical
          view of the city and pleaded for city planning according to artistic principles. “To approach everything in a strictly
          methodical manner and not to waver a hair’s breadth from preconceived patterns, until genius has been strangled
          to death and joie de vivre stifled by the system, that is the sign of our time” (p. 229). Sitte criticized modern
          planning and emphasized the need to examine the building units that composed a city, as opposed to examining the
          whole sanitary drainage or the traffic flows as Haussmann and Cerdá did. He was inspired by old Roman and Greek
          streets and plazas, the building units, that adapted to local conditions and “developed gradually in natura” (pp.
          187-188). He emphasized on the coherent organism of the town achieved through proper correlation of the building
          units. However, Sitte did not drew an analogue to an organism in the same manner as Howard or Geddes, as his perspective
          was different. Instead, he was referring to organic consistency of a city due to proper correlation of its building
          units.

      <section id="general-systems-theory">
        <h4>General Systems Theory</h4>
        <p>After the Second World War, cities faced new problems and the traditional planning system was questioned. To tackle
          the problems, a few geographers sought new literature and discovered the German pioneers on location theory (Hall,
          1996). In Germany the famous Central Place Theory was developed by Christaller (1933) and modified by Lösch (1940).
          It was based on the empirical study of central places in southern Germany in the 1920s. In his study Christaller
          ranked places in a seven-level urban hierarchy based on the market area radius, the population size and the population
          of the market area. These categories went from Marktorte to Amtsort all the way up to Landstadt. He illustrated
          how settlements locate in relation to one another and how they function in a hierarchy based on regional economics.
          He showed that the complexity that Cerda speaks of is in the nature of the urban area and makes it not just a confined
          space amidst lush forests or agricultural lands. It is part of a hierarchical network of towns and cities, and
          not strictly physical, but also economic. Later, Lösch (1940) found Christaller’s theory too rigid as it theorized
          top-down, instead Lösch began with the lowest order, the farms. From there, Lösch derived several central places
          and produced a similar hierarchy as Christaller. However, akin to Sitte, his perspective was different and he theorized
          the network from the building units, the farms, as opposed to Christaller who theorized top-down from the central
          place.
        </p>
        <p>Ullman introduced the Central Place Theory to the United States and used this concept to better reflect the complex
          nature of cities via his multi nuclei model (Harris & Ullman, 1945), but it was not until Isard (1960) that the
          Central Place Theory was popularized. Derived of the new science of cybernetics by Wiener (1948), the aforesaid
          location theory and the General Systems Theory of Von Bertalanffy (1928), cities and regions were now conceived
          holistically and seen as complex systems that were only a specific spatial subset of a whole general class of systems.
          The basic principle behind the General Systems Theory is that complex systems could be decomposed into simpler
          sub-systems, which could be subdivided into smaller subsystems, until elementary components. In this theory, the
          emphasis lies on the inter-connectedness of the parts and the whole and not the elementary components themselves
          (Couclelis, 2000). A characteristic of such a system is described by Kuhn (1976) who argued that systems move towards
          an equilibrium, which suggest cities would be deterministic and have an optimal form. This idea aligns with the
          physicalist concept that was adopted by urban planners such as Haussmann and Cerdá, and continued the traditional
          planning that was set in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 1940s the digital computer appeared which would allow rapid and large-scale numerical processing,
          which would make urban planning more technical. In 1954 Mitchell and Rapkin (1954) suggested that urban traffic
          was a measurable function of urban activity and land use patterns. This insight enabled researchers to operationalize
          their theories on spatial systems with the computational processing and urban modelling, such as Lowry (1964) did
          with his model of metropolis. Accordingly, the first models from the 1950s and 1960s had a heavy engineering-based
          approach and were designed to solve one problem. It was thought these models could solve the problems associated
          with urban growth, because urban patterns are the result of changes in the equilibrium within cities, which could
          be understood from the macro level (Torrens, 2001). At this point in time, urban planning was still applied and
          theorized from the top down, whilst recognizing the complexity of cities.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="emergence">
        <h4>Emergence</h4>
        <p>Leaping back to Geddes' evolutionary paradigm. There was one argument Geddes had missed from Darwin's theory. That
          small changes could lead to big effects. That seemingly unrelated changes can emerge an aggregate order. This key
          argument is made by several influential urbanists in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Alexander (1964) who argued
          from an architectural perspective, that cities were dependent on the context and formed by the context's demand,
          “here the human background which defines the need for new buildings, and the physical environment provided by the
          available sites, make a context for the form of the city's growth” (p. 16). Also, Lefebvre (1974) who argued that
          the spatial relations of the everyday life and social interactions of the population lead to the production of
          space. And of course, Jacobs (1961) who argued that the diversity that increased the quality of a city was formed
          by individual decisions and generated from the bottom upwards. These urbanists all point out that urban complexity
          could be generated as an emergent feature through local interactions. This notion is different from the General
          System Theory, which was concerned with the whole rather than the separation into individual parts. Instead, the
          aggregate system was thought to be derived of the interactions by individual parts. This is similar to how Lösch
          modified the Central Place Theory, where he left overarching hierarchy intact but changed the perspective on how
          achieve that hierarchy, i.e. from the bottom-up.</p>
        <p>The first traditional urban models were not able to capture this emergent feature of urban complexity. As the mechanistic
          way cities were perceived, due to the modernistic legacy, was counter to the diversity that composed cities and
          thus destroyed heterogeneity. Lefebvre (2014) referred to this process as dissolving cities, where cities had become
          more homogeneous due to the physicalist approach planners had adopted, who tried to control society and events
          from the top-down. The underpinning issue was that cities were perceived as problems of simplicity, conversely:
          “cities happen to be problems in organized complexity, like the life sciences, they present situations in which
          a half-dozen or even several dozen quantities are all varying simultaneously and in subtly interconnected ways.
          Cities, again like the life sciences, do not exhibit one problem in organized complexity, which if understood explains
          all. They can be analyzed into many such problems or segments which, as in the case of the life sciences, are also
          related with one another. The variables are many, but they are not helter-skelter; they are interrelated into an
          organic whole" (Jacobs, 1961, p. 559). Both the General Systems Theory and the organized complexity that Jacobs
          speaks of, research complex systems. They are in fact complementary theoretical approaches. However, the fundamental
          difference is that the first is theorized top-down and the latter, is theorized bottom-up (Couclelis, 2000).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="cellular-automata">
        <h4>Cellular Automata</h4>
        <p>The CA was developed in the 1940s by Ulam (1962), who studied the growth of crystals and Von Neumann (1966), who
          studied self-replicating systems. Both were inspired by the various technological advancements in electronic computing
          made by Turing. Von Nuemann believed that computers through software under certain rules or instructions could
          replicate complex structures and patterns. From this notion, he concluded that the elements of reproducibility
          should be cells. Von Neumann had drawn inspiration from Ulam, who suggested to use a discrete system to represent
          the self-replicating systems. He believed that simple cellular automata was found in a set of local rules that
          generated mathematical patterns in 2D or 3D space, where local actions would produce global order (Batty, 2005).
          From this, Conway (Gardner, 1970) developed the Game of Life that combined all these CA elements in a simple manner.
          The game showed that complex patterns could emerge, bottom-up, from simple transition rules and simple cell configurations.</p>
        <p>Therefrom, Tobler (1979) was the first who proposed to reduce geographic complexity to cells, thus using cellular
          space for geographic modelling. He showed how the earth's surface could be divided into an array of cells to which
          matrix algebra could be applied to gain, as he called it, interesting results. Later, Wolfram (1984b) demonstrated
          that natural systems of great diversity and complex patterns could be modeled based on mathematical equations in
          a discrete space and time. Wolfram (1984b) stated that one of the greatest advantages is the flexibility in CA,
          as they do not required complex mathematical equations or analytical equilibrium problems to be solved. Additionally,
          Wolfram (1984a) noticed that, at least for 1D, CA could be categorized in four distinct classes of behavior: evolution
          that lead to homogenous states; evolution leads to a set of separate stables structures; evolution leads to chaotic
          patterns; and evolution leads to complex localized structures. With this classification, Wolfram drew an analogue
          between these four classes of behavior and the attractors in continuous dynamical systems, thus suggesting the
          link to Chaos Theory.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Tobler, Couclelis (1985; 1989) developed the first theoretical approaches for the spatial application
          of cellular automata to cities. After which, Itami (1994) theorized that if cellular automata is applied to a lattice,
          a grid of geographical data, thus it can be integrated into GIS to facilitate visualization and interpretation
          of the simulation results. Then in the 1990s, the first urban CA models were developed with GIS by Batty and Xie
          (1994), White et al. (1997) and Clarke et al. (1997).</p>

        <h4>Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry</h4>
        <p>To further expand complexity, cities were linked to chaotic dynamics by Dendrinos and Sonis (1990). Chaos is a powerful
          metaphor that invokes an image of randomness, confusion and disorder. Chaos Theory studies the behavior and initial
          conditions of dynamical systems that are deterministic, yet difficult to predict. The nature and degree of the
          relationship between the parts in a chaotic system is not perfectly known, therefore the system is unpredictable.
          However, there is a sense of underlying order and structure that could evolve in time through self-organization,
          which means the parts act in a collective manner through feedback mechanisms and emerge into aggregate patterns.
          The system has no optimal form or end-state, it has inequities and inefficiencies, but it is resilient within limits.
          Wolfram showed that initial conditions of a CA could be completely random, and still order and structure would
          appear through the self-organization and interaction between cells (Wolfram, 1984a; Wolfram, 1984b).</p>
        <p>Fractals are dynamical objects and are essentially a visualization of chaotic dynamics. Mandelbrot (1983) worked
          on fractal geometry and showed that complex structures in nature could be described by mathematical laws. He coined
          the term fractal to mean any fragmented structure with infinite complexity through self-similarity. Thus, important
          characteristics of fractals are self-similarity and scale dependency. Self-similarity means that the parts have
          the same shape as the whole, which makes the form scale-less. Further, he noted that fractals are the emergent
          property of iterative feedback systems, which are both unpredictable and deterministic, forming patterns that are
          complex yet coherent structures. Batty and Longley (1994) connected fractal geometry to cities and applied it via
          CA, whereby this dynamical system would function in a discrete time and space. Furthermore, Batty and Xie (1999)
          theorized on self-organized criticality, which means that cities have a critical point as an attractor. Thus global
          patterns in cities emerge from local actions, which is the essence of self-organization. They evolve to a critical
          point between order and disorder, holding themselves at this critical level until certain conditions emerge (i.e.
          new technologies), which could abruptly redirect the system to a new threshold.</p>

        <h4>Complexity Theory</h4>
        <p>During the last two decades the field of urban modelling evolved rapidly and provided new tools to understand the
          drivers of change behind urban dynamics, evaluate these driving forces and predict future urban dynamics. Urban
          dynamics is a complex process as it is influenced by social, economic, political and environmental factors and
          many more driving forces across various spatial and temporal scales. Describing and understanding these drivers
          of change, how they interrelate and how they have evolved is a difficult yet critical component of urban planning.
          For studying urban dynamics, CA became a popular and successful modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate
          complex, emerging patterns. During the 1980s Geographical Information Systems emerged, which contributed to conducting
          real simulations (Couclelis, 1997) and to combine graphics, chaos, fractals and complexity via cellular automata
          (Benenson & Torrens, 2004). Batty (2005) discussed in great detail what these drivers of urban change presumably
          are and how these can be applied to CA.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, complexity is the underlying principle of CA. However defining complexity is difficult as it
          has no precise definition, but it does have certain characteristics such as: self-organized criticality, dynamical,
          chaotic and critical nature, non-linearity, emergence and self-similarity. Cities are examples of complex systems
          (Batty, 2014), which shows that urban problems are in fact not simple nor objective. And by looking at a city through
          the lens of Complexity Theory, one could apply these characteristics of previously mentioned paradigms and theories.
          Key to a complex system is that it is a collection of elements that is related yet act independently through competition
          and co-evolution. The system evolves in time through self-organization and emergence. A city is not in equilibrium
          and it does not grow towards an optimal form. It has inequities and inefficiencies that may reveal in its physical
          form. However, it is self-sustaining and will hold itself at critical levels through self-organization, before
          abruptly changing to a new threshold.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Urban Modelling</h3>
      <p>A theory is a concept or abstraction of real world phenomena that enables simplification. Subsequently, a model is
        the simplification of real world phenomena and represents objects in the real world or how processes in the real
        world are believed to function. Thus, a model is built upon a theoretical construct that describes and represent
        these objects, processes and relations. Putting theory into a logical framework and a form that can be manipulated,
        e.g. the digital environment of the computer, is referred to as modelling (Longley et al., 2010). This allows for
        control over endogenous and exogenous variables and enables experimentation to help understand situations not yet
        realized or how a situation came to be. Accordingly, the operationalization of a model is referred to as simulation.
        The goal of modelling is to explore and evaluate changes in relations over time and space and to contribute to scientific
        theory. Therefore, a good model would be able to simulate the outcome of a set of input parameters, as they would
        affect the real world (Batty, 1976).</p>
      <p>Models are used in various ways, from daily life to scientific research, and in various disciplines, from social sciences
        to spatial economics. The abstraction of space and spatial relations is referred to as spatial modelling, and the
        application of a spatial model to the urban environment, as urban modelling. Hence, an urban model is one type of
        application of modelling (Clarke, 2014). Urban models could represent simple lines or zones, or they can suggest
        urban structure and form such as the multi nuclei model (Harris & Ullman, 1945) and the monocentric city (Burgess,
        1924). Nowadays, typically through computer simulations, the theory on how a city or environment is believed to function
        translates into a form that is testable and applicable, without experimenting on the cities themselves (Batty, 2009).
        Thereby, an urban model has become a tool that allows for simplification of the urban complexity, which makes the
        characteristics of the driving forces and their spatial and temporal scales more easily identifiable (Goldstein et
        al., 2004). With this information, an urban model could simulate historical urban change in order to fathom the present,
        and forecast future urban change to explore the future dynamics. In other words, the task of an urban model is to
        simplify the urban complexity and place it in a spatial and temporal perspective.</p>
      <p>Urban planners are inherently future-orientated, and being able to predict and control urban change and growth is an
        essential part of urban planning. The field of urban modelling attempts to support urban planners to fill the knowledge-gap
        of not knowing what the future will hold or what the consequences would be of their spatial plans. Urban models provide
        an inexpensive and effective way to anticipate problems and urban change (Clarke, 2014), thus it can give planners
        the necessary data and the opportunity to act upon the effects of urban dynamics. It allows for the analysis of the
        urban complexity and provides an opportunity to evaluate land use policies and help to visualize alternate scenarios.
        Due to the uncertainty related to simulating and predicting urban dynamics, urban models have always been criticized,
        due to their inability to precisely predict future changes. Moreover, urban models ought to be behaviorally valid
        regarding the object, processes and relations they represent. Despite this, urban models are still worthwhile since
        they can simulate urban change and the consequences on the built and natural environment and provide a rough possible
        indication of urban dynamics (Pettit, 2005).</p>
      <section id="model-structure">
        <h4>Model Structure</h4>
        <p>Urban models consist of a set of fundamental principles: scale, time, aggregation and representation. Firstly, scale,
          which is concerned with the distinction between micro and macro, referring to the spatial scale of the model and
          also the level of aggregation. Macro models tend to deal with large groups, institutions or large aggregation of
          activity, whilst micro models the behavior of individuals. The second relates to time and whether a model reflects
          static or dynamic elements of the urban structure (Batty, 2009; Batty, 1976). Models could describe a structure
          at a cross-section in time, or even various periods in time. Subsequently, both time and scale could be described
          through the level of aggregation, which deals with how far the data can be disaggregated in terms of temporal or
          spatial scale (Lowry, 1961). Disaggregating data could potentially increase the accuracy and simultaneously increases
          the complexity of the model. Generally, the finer the spatial scale and shorter the time period, the greater the
          dynamic in activities. Therefrom, as this activity is aggregated, its heterogeneity is reduced. Lastly, representation,
          which is a key to all the previous principles. It involves how the model outcome is visualized, as individual or
          aggregated groups, per year or per decade. Urban models tend to groups or categories into zones or periods, which
          influences the level of aggregation and heterogeneity.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="model-reliability">
        <h4>Model reliability</h4>
        <p>Furthermore, urban models need to be reliable if they are used to support decision-making. Hence, models follow a
          certain process that explores their reliability: verification, calibration, validation and prediction. The first
          of these is verification, which is the process of testing the model for internal consistency and is often a separate
          step from testing how well the model’s simulations are (Batty, 1976; Silva & Clarke, 2002). Crucial is under what
          conditions the model is found acceptable. During this phase the model-user is confirming whether a model matches
          its design or theory, and works correctly.</p>
        <p>Secondly, calibration, which is the dimensioning of the model to find estimates of values for unknown parameters
          and constraints that enable the model to reproduce known characteristics of the data in the most fitting way (Pontius,
          et al., 2004). The measures used to increase the agreement during calibration are called goodness of fit statistics.
          Goodness of fit refers to how well the model fits to the actual data. It is a well-defined measure of how the model’s
          simulations match the known observations. Ordinarily, calibration involves two major problems: (a) defining the
          statistics which measure the goodness of fit of the model and (b) having defined these statistics, finding the
          best estimates of values for the model’s parameters (Batty, 1976).</p>
        <p>Thirdly, the model is validated, which is distinct from calibration, since “calibration is only a process of determining
          the values of certain variables which relate to the particular area under study… validation, on the other hand,
          depends upon whether or not the structure of the model reflects reality to the desired degree” (Batty, 1976, p.
          356). Therefore, validation is a demonstration that a model, and underlying hypotheses and theories, possess a
          satisfactory range of accuracy with regard to replicating the evolution of the urban structure in a behaviorally
          valid manner (Pontius, et al., 2004). In this process theories are matched against the facts, whereby they are
          either falsified or confirmed. Validation is a necessary step before it can be used to make predictions of future
          urban growth.</p>
        <p>Lastly, predictions, which is any outcome of the model, so these could be related to the past, present or future.
          Generally, this relates to forecasting based on a set of best-fit estimates of parameter values in order to explore
          future urban dynamics.</p>

        <h4>2.3 Methods of urban modelling</h4>
        <p>There are various ways to categorize urban models and many authors have done so. This research will not present a
          detailed overview of the history of urban modelling. This can be found in Batty (1976) and Fujita, Krugman and
          Venables (2001) for traditional spatial models, and a more general overview of urban modelling in Batty (2014).
          Additionally, Timmermans (2003) provides an historic overview, wherein he categorized the urban models into three
          waves and provided an extensive list of commonly applied urban models in the past. The next sections will address
          two types of modelling methods that Torrens (2001) called “new wave” models: CA and agent-based models (ABM). These
          two modelling methods have properties of complexity, such as emergence and self-organization, and are paradigmatic
          for the application of complexity in urban modelling.</p>
        <section>
          <h5>Cellular Automata</h5>
          <p>A CA contains a collection of cells, representing real world objects, on a grid that evolves through a number of
            discrete time steps, according to certain transition rules based on the neighboring cells. These rules are applied
            iteratively for a certain amount of times. Essentially, a CA has five principle characteristics: the lattice,
            the cells, the cell states, the neighborhood and the transition rules (<a href="#figure-02">Figure 2</a>).
            <ul>
              <li>The lattice is a reference set of cells in a regular uniform array, with discrete values at each of the cells
                (such as land use categories). It has n dimensions, but in urban modelling mostly two or three dimensions
                are used.</li>
              <li>The cell is a subunit of the lattice and represents real world objects. It usually has a rectangular shape,
                however irregular polygons, hexagon or links have been used.</li>
              <li>The cell resides in a neighborhood, which are the cells closest to the central cell. The two most common configurations
                of the neighborhood in a 2D-lattice are: the Von Neumann neighborhood and Moore neighborhood (<a href="#figure-02">Figure 2</a>),
                although many different neighborhoods have been used.</li>
              <li>These cells have a cell state, which is a variable associated with the cell. Cells take on one state and change
                during each time step and are updated synchronously during each time step, The cell states can be (a) binary
                values (urban, non-urban), (b) qualitative values that represent different land use categories, (c) quantitative
                values that represent population or urban density or (d) a vector of several attributes (Sante, Garcia, Miranda,
                & Crecente, 2010).</li>
              <li>The transition rules control the state changes of all the cells in the lattice. During the simulation the central
                cell reacts to the states of the neighboring cells, resulting in a state change. Thus, the state change is
                invoked locally and there is no action beyond the neighborhood, which implies emergence. Further, it is assumed
                the transition rules are uniform, they apply to all cells, states and neighborhood at all times (Batty, 2005;
                Wolfram, 1984b). In this process, the transition rules are usually applied sequentially, e.g. in the lattice
                in <a href="#figure-02">Figure 2</a>, starting at the cell in the top left corner, iterating to the bottom
                right corner, cell-by-cell. Therefore each cell acts independently and cells invoke changes upon another
                from which patterns emerge, implying self-organization. Typically, cells change simultaneously, meaning the
                CA iterates cell-by-cell and all cells will be processed, but change is not invoked after all cells have
                been processed.</li>
            </ul>
            <figure id="figure-02">
              <img src="media/cellular_automata.png"></img>
              <figcaption>Figure 2: Visualization of the CA principles: lattice, cells, neighborhood, cell states, and transition rules.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In order for a CA to operate, it has initial and boundary conditions, which refer to the start- and endpoint
              of the simulation in time and space. The initial conditions apply to the spatial configuration of the cells,
              cell states and neighborhoods and the time at which the process begins. The boundary conditions refer to the
              spatial extent of the lattice, size of the neighborhood and the time over which the CA is allowed to operate
              (Batty, 2005). Therefore, CA is a discrete spatial-temporal system, since it has predefined spatial and temporal
              boundaries and evolves in discrete time steps.</p>
            <p>From these basic principles, Wolfram (1984a) realized that CA can replicate complexity and outlined some of the
              characteristics that CA possess: “(a) the correspondence between physical and computation processes are clear;
              (b) CA are often based on transition rules that are simpler than complex mathematical equations, but produce
              results which are more comprehensive; (c) CA can be modeled using computers with no loss of precision; (d)
              CA can mimic the action of any possible physical system; (e) CA are irreducible” (Itami, 1994, p. 30). These
              characteristics imply that there is no pre-knowledge of an aggregate order and global patterns emerge from
              local interaction. In fact, Wolfram showed that the initial conditions of a CA could be completely random,
              and still order and structure could appear through the interaction between cells (Wolfram, 1984a; Wolfram,
              1984b). This idea that micro interactions lead to global patterns, is at the basis of CA. This implies that
              patterns are engraved in several scales, thus they hold characteristics of fractal geometry as self-similarity
              and scale dependency (Batty & Longley, 1994).</p>
            <p>“Simple cellular automata are characterized by phase transitions between behavior types, so that a single model
              can result in stability, stochastic instability or chaos” (Clarke & Gaydos, 1998, p. 700). These are properties
              of chaotic and dynamical system that evolve through self-organized criticality, which means they evolve to
              a critical point between order and disorder, holding themselves at this critical level until certain conditions
              emerge, which could abruptly redirect the system to a new threshold. A good example of this is the Glider Gun,
              which is a cellular configuration in Conway’s Game of Life. In this a cellular configuration two objects, i.e.
              clusters of pixels that are alive, exist in homogenous cellular space of pixels that are dead. Due to transition
              rules, these two objects move through cellular space in stability. However, when these two objects collide,
              i.e. the critical point between order and disorder, a phase transition occurs and a new cluster of alive pixels
              emerges and moves away from the two objects. The opposite also occurs in this game, when the two objects collide
              with static objects in cellular space. In that case new alive pixels emerge, but quickly dissipate. Overall,
              this pattern repeats endlessly, therefore this spatial configuration is stable, whilst periodically being chaotic
              and abruptly redirecting to new thresholds.</p>
            <p>Some examples of CA will be discussed in <a href="#23-urban-models">section 2.3</a> Metronamica, Dinamica EGO,
              CLUE and SLEUTH. Besides these four models, Sante et al. (2010) provided an overview of urban CA models applied
              to real-world cases, along with an analysis of their capabilities and limitations.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>Agent-based models</h5>
          <p>Agent-based models (ABM) use individual behavior and try to predict behavior in the future. ABM, like CA, also
            have the same characteristic with regard to complexity, such as emergence and self-organization, however, in
            this case it comes from agents. Both ABM and CA primarily attempt to model the complexity of the entire system,
            wherein individual units exist. CA focusses on modelling urban dynamics which emerges from local interactions,
            whilst ABM simulates more complex situations where agents control their own actions based on their perception
            of the environment. Agents could mean several things based on the level of aggregation, from individuals to groups
            or institutions, humans, plants, animals or artificial life. In essence, agents are objects that do not have
            a fixed location, but act and interact with one another, as well as the environment wherein they exist. Therefore,
            the main difference with CA, is that agents could be perceived as ‘mobile cells’ and agents can motivate their
            own actions, which can imply movement, conversely, cells merely represent landscapes on which an activity takes
            place. Furthermore, CA are limited to their cell size, whereas agents could scale down further to individual
            coordinates (Heppenstall, Crooks, See, & Batty, 2012; Batty, 2005).</p>
          <p>The key element of agents is that they are autonomous, they act independently, although could act in synchrony
            depending on various conditions displayed by other agents or systems. Franklin and Graesser (1997) provided a
            formal definition of the autonomous agent: “An autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an
            environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to
            effect what it senses in the future” (p. 25). Agents operate in said environment to which they are uniquely adapted
            and wherein they communicate. In that same environment, there may be more than one type of agent. In urban modelling,
            that environment could be networks or cellular space. In addition, there are two types of agents: reactive agents
            and cognitive agents. Reactive agents will behave by reacting to the environment or to other agents. A cognitive
            agent may do the same, but they also act according to their own protocol. The way agents act in their environment
            is the dominant factor in the behavior of an ABM. <a href="#table-01">Table 1</a> shows a range of properties,
            from passive agents to active agents that display some kind of intelligence.</p>

          <p><a href="#figure-03">Figure 3</a> illustrates the basic structure of an ABM. The agent and the landscape interact,
            therein there are four basic types of relations: agents influencing their own behavior, landscape influencing
            their own state, agents affecting the landscapes, and the landscape affecting agents. Besides this generic structure,
            there are two more significant interactions: other agents and landscapes, and influences from external variables.
            As seen in Figure 3, this leads to four more relations, and a total of eight basic relations in an ABM. The other
            four being: an agent influenced by other agents, an agent influenced by external variables, landscape influenced
            by other landscape, and landscape influenced by external variables (Batty, 2005; Heppenstall, et al., 2012).</p>
          <p>For urban modelling, ABM is useful for representing mobile entities in the environment, such as households, vehicles
            or people (Torrens, 2001). Hence, in the 1990s these were first applied to transportation dynamics, when activity-based
            analysis gained interest. Timmermans, Arentze and Joh (2002) provided an overview of the origins of transportation
            activity-based modelling.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>A noteworthy example of ABM is, TRANSIMS (TRansporation Analysis SIMulation System), which is a system of travel
            modelling procedures that conducts transportation analyses. The goal of TRANSIMS is to load traffic onto a network
            and iterate towards the Nash equilibrium. The outputs of TRANSIMS are: detailed data on travel, congestion, and
            emissions (US Department of Transportation, 2015). Furthermore, TASHA (Travel/Activity Scheduler for Household
            Agents), which is an ABM microsimulation model developed for the Greater Toronto Area. It simulates the scheduling
            of out-of-home activity and the travel a person (or household) might engage during a typical weekday (Miller
            & Roorda, 2003). Similarly ALBATROSS, which is also an activity-scheduling model. This model predicts which activities
            are conducted when, their duration, start time, trip type, travel party, location and transport mode (Arentze
            & Timmermans, 2000).</p>

          <h5>Linking CA and ABM</h5>
          <p>Historically, CA have been developed to simulate urban dynamics by urban planners and ABM to simulate activity-based
            dynamics by transportation planners. To some extent, these two fields separately developed their own approaches
            and methodologies and could be considered disconnected. Cerdá noted that the infrastructure and specifically
            the circulation of the infrastructure were fundamental to urbanization, thus suggesting that the distribution
            of land use and transportation are strongly connected (Soria y Puig, 1999). Accordingly, these two fields are
            not disconnected and their modelling approaches can complement each other, as cells are no decision-makers and
            agents do have those capabilities (Timmermans, 2006).</p>
          <p>In that light, there has been ongoing research on integrated land use – transportation models. The first model
            to bridge the gap was SIMPOP, the first application of a multi-agent system in geography (Bura, Guérin-Pace,
            Mathian, Pumain, & Sanders, 1996). In SIMPOP Bura et al. (1996) used the environment to model the evolution of
            cities over long periods of time. The objective was to identify the conditions of emergence of a system of towns
            and cities from an initial homogenous rural settlement pattern, over a duration of 2000 years. There were two
            differences between regular ABM and SIMPOP: (a) in SIMPOP the agents were immobile as they represented geographic
            locations, and (b) SIMPOP simulated the interaction between towns and cities, therefore the behavior was not
            reducible to the behavior of individual persons (Pumain, 2012). Hence, it could be argued that SIMPOP was not
            a true ABM, and more a special case of a CA model (Timmermans, 2003).</p>
          <p>Ligtenberg, Bregt and Van Lammeren (2001) developed a combined CA and ABM technique that simulates urban change
            as a result of individual actor behavior. In their model actors negotiated on the allocation of new urbanization.
            Through time, each actor developed a series of preferences that depict its ideas on future urban change. In that
            process, there were no pre-defined local or regional constraints, such as urban suitability, policy restrictions
            or price of land. The preferences of the actors translated into urban change through a voting process on possible
            allocations. Moreover, other applications of ABM to land use and land cover change can be found in Parker et
            al. (2003) and Wu and Silva (2010), who both provided an overview of AB-CA (Agent-based cellular automata).</p>
          <p>Essentially, linking CA to ABM is part of a larger discussion, wherein disadvantages of certain model methods can
            be complemented by other model methods. For example, cells are not decision-makers, and agents to have that capability,
            thus using agents to allocate cell state transitions, is a complementary methodology. Additionally, Torrens (2001)
            noted that CA and ABM models lack the ability to simulate macro, top-down systems, since both evolve from the
            bottom-up. Therefore, he argued the need for hybrid models, which in addition to using the CA or ABM methods,
            would be complemented with traditional aggregate models. Since 2001, this is more common, as can be seen in Heppenstall
            et al. (2012), wherein various chapters, with various examples, are dedicated to these hybrid models. It has
            been argued that to address urban complexity, it would be better to use submodels as opposed to incorporating
            more data and more factors (Chaudhuri & Clarke, 2013a), thus models complementing each other as opposed to the
            ‘one-model-to-simulate-it-all’.

      <h3>2.3 Urban Models</h3>
      <p>The following section comprises a review of several urban models. This review aims at discussing what is currently
        available and commonly used. It is not attempting to provide a thorough comparative analysis of various urban models.
        The models that are reviewed are: UrbanSim, Dinamica EGO, Metronamica, CLUE and SLEUTH, the urban model that was
        used in this study. All of the aforementioned models explained in this section are designed to model urban development.
        However, each model adopts a different approach, therefore, in this next section for each model a brief overview
        is presented describing the model structure, data requirements and allocation mechanism.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="24-section-conclusions">
      <h3>2.3 Section Conclusions</h3>
      <p><a href="#21-complexity-theory">Section 2.1</a> provided a brief history of Complexity Theory by introducing some key
        theories and paradigms associated with complexity. Complexity has a long history and has been applied across various
        disciplines. Key to complexity is that it does not have a precise definition, instead, it is described by characteristics,
        such as self-organizing, dynamical, chaotic and critical nature, non-linearity, emergence and self-similarity. Wolfram
        (1984b) showed that these characteristics exist in CA, hence CA is often linked to Complexity Theory.</p>
      <p><a href="#22-urban-modelling">Section 2.2</a> provided the fundamental principles of urban modelling as well as the
        terminology associated with urban modelling. There are a variety of modelling methods that are not described in this
        research, from more traditional models as applied from the 1950s, to other current model methods such as microsimulation.
        Instead, the basic structure and approach of CA and ABM are elaborated, since both have the properties of complexity.
        Whilst Complexity Theory may be vague and difficult to grasp at times, describing these two modelling methods, could
        clarify the meaning of Complexity Theory and its characteristics, such as emergence and self-organization. Moreover,
        section 2.2 discussed model coupling, which has become more popular and more frequently applied over the last 15
        years to improve urban modelling, whereby disadvantages of a model method can be complemented by other model methods.</p>
      <p><a href="#23-urban-models">Section 2.3</a> described five urban models: UrbanSim, Metronamica, Dinamica EGO, CLUE and
        SLEUTH. It illustrated that there are similarities and differences between the models. For example, all models are
        free, except for Metronamica, and only UrbanSim, Dinamica EGO and SLEUTH are also open-source. Out of the five models,
        all comprise CA in some sort of way, however UrbanSim also uses agents through microsimulation. All the models are
        coupled with other submodels, either aggregate models, as is the case with UrbanSim, Metronamica and CLUE or other
        CA methods, as with SLEUTH and Dinamica EGO. UrbanSim and Metronamica are the only two models that incorporate transportation,
        via submodels. All models, except SLEUTH, adopted a multi-scale approach. Another key difference is related to the
        complexity of using the model. For example, UrbanSim is a data-driven model and requires extensive amounts of data,
        thus acquiring and calibrating the data is time-consuming. Conversely, SLEUTH requires much less input data and is
        relatively simple to execute and calibrate. Besides the differences and similarities, there are also interesting
        or novel features used in the five models, for example: UrbanSim holds the option for user-specific events; Metronamica
        employs an extended neighborhood with distance decay functionality; Dinamica EGO contains a dynamic feedback mechanism
        through dynamic suitability layers; CLUE uses a novel multi-scale allocation mechanism; and SLEUTH consists of the
        self-modification module.</p>
      <p>All these models have been successfully applied worldwide and would be able to simulate land cover change, as required
        in this research. Nonetheless, the reasons for choosing SLEUTH are that: (a) any researcher can use the model at
        no cost if they have the required input data; (b) SLEUTH is relatively easy to use for simulation and prediction,
        also due to the presence of many background documents and an internet discussion board; (c) the model is scale independent,
        meaning that any spatial resolution could be used as long as it is consistent; (d) the model has been developed by
        various research teams and is not for one specific location, therefore, it can be applied to many regions; and (e)
        SLEUTH is an open-source model, thus it has availability to the source code. Additionally, for this study SLEUTH-3r
        was used as this version has improved functionality and is computationally more efficient than SLEUTH.</p>
      <p>It is important to acknowledge some drawbacks of SLEUTH. As stated in <a href="#1-introduction">Chapter 1</a>, the
        goal of the study is to simulate and predict land cover change for Groningen, which adopted a clear compact city
        policy. However, the compact city policy is about more than urban land cover change and minimizing the spatial footprint
        of the city, it also involves multi-functional land use, high frequency transportation and urban densification, etc.
        (Zonneveld, 1991). SLEUTH is developed on the assumption that five types of growth occur in urban areas and these
        are all related to urban expansion as opposed to urban densification (Clarke, et al., 1997). Koomen and Borsboom-van
        Beurden (2011) pointed out, in the Netherlands there is a need for policy-makers to know about densification in cities
        as well. Other CA have been applied using a simple two or three class density classification (Veerbeek, Pathirana,
        Ashley, & Zevenbergen, 2015; Zhang, Ban, Liu, & Hu, 2011). With regard to the compact city policy it would be useful
        to accommodate for multi-functional land use, which has been applied in the field of cellular automata by representing
        single cells as multiple classes (Crols, et al., 2015; White, Uljee, & Engelen, 2012), or as is the case with CLUE,
        where coarse cell could contain several classes based on the constituent cells at a finer scale (Verburg, et al.,
        1999). Furthermore, another decisive component of the compact city policy is transportation, which some urban models
        include, as is the case in Metronamica, UrbanSim or other integrated land use – transportation models (Timmermans,
        2006).
      </p>
      <p>SLEUTH does not have the mechanisms to explicitly deal with all the aforementioned components of the compact city policy,
        however could be included by model coupling or rewriting the source-code. Either of those does not fit into the scope
        of this research, since: (a) both are time-consuming, which does not fit into the timeframe of this research; (b)
        this is an exploratory research that tries to fit SLEUTH to Groningen, not improve SLEUTH’s functionality; and (c)
        this research focusses on the core of the compact city policy, which is minimizing the urban footprint. Therefore,
        this research focusses on what SLEUTH does best, land cover change (Chaudhuri & Clarke, 2013b), whilst acknowledging
        other relevant components of the compact city policy exist, but are not researched in this study.</p>
