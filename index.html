    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As urbanization occurs, cities and villages expand outwards claiming new areas. This process exerts high pressure on
      the open and natural environment and signifies the importance of urban management and development. However, the driving
      forces and effects associated with urbanization affect various disciplines, and temporal and spatial scales, which
      makes understanding and describing them and their interrelations a complex issue (Goldstein, et al. 2004). An urban
      model could function as a planning support system to obtain said knowledge, because it enables the simplification of
      urban complexity and allows to combine several disciplines in a multi-disciplinary approach. For studying the urban
      environment, cellular automata has become a popular and successful modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate
      the urban complexity.</p>
    <p>This master’s thesis was aimed at studying the urban growth patterns in Groningen by applying a planning support system,
      namely the cellular automaton SLEUTH. The main objective of this research was to calibrate and validate SLEUTH to fit
      Groningen’s context in an attempt to predict the future land cover change of Groningen up to 2045. It did this with
      an integrated application of: Geographical Information Systems, remote sensing, and a multicriteria evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>The cellular automata method is underpinned by Complexity Theory. A theory that does not have a precise definition, instead,
      it is described by characteristics, such as self-organizing, dynamical, chaotic and critical nature, non-linearity,
      emergence and self-similarity. These characteristics are derived from other paradigms that reach back to the 19th century,
      such as Cerdá’s Theory on Urbanización and Geddes’ Evolutionary Paradigm and Emergence, and other paradigms that have
      roots in physics and mathematics, such as The General Systems Theory, Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. Wolfram (1984b)
      showed that the characteristics of these paradigms and theories exist in cellular automata, and cellular automatons
      were able to capture complex emerging structures based on simple mathematical rules. Couclelis (1985; 1989) developed
      the first theoretical approaches for the spatial application of cellular automata to cities. After which, Itami (1994)
      theorized that if cellular automata is applied to a lattice, it could also be integrated into Geographical Information
      Systems to facilitate visualization and interpretation of the simulation results. Then in the 1990s, the first urban
      cellular automatons were developed by Batty and Xie (1994), White et al. (1997) and Clarke et al. (1997).</p>
    <p>In this master’s thesis an overview was presented of fundamental principles of urban modelling, after which two modelling
      methods were elaborated: agent-based modelling and cellular automata. Five urban models are discussed that can simulate
      land cover change (UrbanSim, Metronamica, Dinamica EGO, CLUE and SLEUTH), thereafter the SLEUTH model is adopted for
      this research and explained in detail. The urban extent input data was derived from a land use classification by object-based
      remote sensing. In addition, the excluded layer is an important input data layer of SLEUTH, as it plays a key role
      in accommodating for the dispersed urban growth patterns in Groningen. For this study, the excluded layer was an urbanization-suitability
      layer through a multicriteria evaluation, wherein factors were standardized through fuzzy set theory and weighted by
      analytical hierarchy process.</p>
    <p>Further, calibration and validation are essential parts of predictive modelling and become even more important when models
      are used as planning support systems. Often the schism between these parts is poorly defined (Pontius, et al., 2004).
      In light of this critique, the validation procedure for his research was separated through time, where the input data
      from 1973 up to 2006 was part of model calibration through the use of a regular ‘Brute-Force’ calibration with the
      Optimal SLEUTH metric (Silva & Clarke, 2002), and the urban area and patterns of 2006 up to 2015 was predicted, which
      were used for model validation by three-map comparison (Pontius, et al., 2008), budgets of components of agreement
      and disagreement, and multiple resolution comparison (Pontius, et al., 2011; Pontius, et al., 2004).</p>
    <p>The modelling results of calibration showed that based on the goodness of fit measures that E0 performed below acceptable,
      which is the regular excluded layer only incorporating constraints. E1 should be considered a questionable result,
      which is the excluded layer based on a multicriteria evaluation. E2 and E3 achieved sufficient fit, which are the excluded
      layers based on a multicriteria evaluation that includes the policies of respectively, 1971 and 1978. Validation showed
      that for none of the excluded layers, the amount correctly predicted change was larger than the sum of the various
      types of error, i.e. a figure of merit of 50%. In fact, the highest overall figure of merit was only 25%, showing SLEUTH
      had difficulties in accurately simulating under these circumstances. Further, validation showed that all excluded layers
      achieved higher fit-score than their random counterpart, yet none were able to achieve higher fit-scores than the null
      map at the finest resolution (i.e. 30 m). Which suggest that having a map of 2006 is a better predictor of the urban
      growth patterns in 2015 than any of the excluded layers at the finest resolution. Notwithstanding, allocation disagreement
      resolved at coarser resolutions and at a resolution of 16 or 32 times the cell side, E2 and E3 were more accurate than
      the null map and the random map, and achieved a figure of merit up to 30%. This suggests that SLEUTH is able to provide
      good expression of neighborhood relationship at coarser scales. In addition, based on validation and compared to the
      FOM of other applications (Pontius, et al., 2008), E2 and E3 could be classified as reasonably accurate, E0 had a low
      accuracy and E1 had mediocre accuracy at best. Further in-depth analysis showed that SLEUTH lacks mechanism that were
      found important to the study area. For example, the study area could benefit from a multi-scale or multi-resolution
      approach, and the inclusion of models that could forecast regional demands regarding real-estate and changes in demographics,
      to account for regional differences.</p>
    <p>Concluding, to answer to the main research question, none of the excluded layers were capable of capturing the dispersed
      urban growth patterns in the study area during simulation or prediction. Hence, the assumption was made that the scenarios
      used for predicting, would also not be able to produce accurate urban growth patterns, as these are based on the same
      principles as used in the excluded layers. Despite, the integrated application of Geographical Information Systems,
      remote sensing, a multicriteria evaluation for urban suitability and SLEUTH, did show (much) higher goodness of fit
      and (much) higher accuracy for the excluded layers that incorporated an urbanization-suitability layer based on an
      multicriteria evaluation, as compared to the excluded layer that did not. Thus, SLEUTH’s excluded layer could be further
      tested and improved to fit Groningen’s context, SLEUTH could be coupled with complementary methods to include demographics
      or socio-economic variables, or a different urban model could be used that includes more sophisticated mechanics.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>The concentration of population in urban areas and the subsequent urbanization are world-wide phenomena. The various
      effects of urbanization have been studied since the 19th century and were often considered a problem that could be,
      and should be, controlled via planning and policies. This kind of approach has its roots in physicalism, a concept
      that urban problems could be solved by shaping the physical urban environment (Batty & Marshall, 2009). Ever since
      the 19th century, with the rise of Urbanism as a science (Soria y Puig, 1999), planning and policies aimed at manipulating
      the physical environment were seen as the solution to controlling the effects caused by urban growth. However, as urbanization
      is of great complexity, affecting the urban structure at multiple spatial and temporal scales, the effects of policies
      and urban plans regularly had unforeseen consequence (Batty, 2014). Controlling the city, its effects, problems and
      inhabitants was not that straightforward.</p>
    <p>At the end of the 1940s the digital computer appeared, which allowed rapid and large-scale numerical processing. This
      new technology enabled researchers to operationalize their mathematical theories on spatial systems via urban modelling
      in an attempt to unravel the urban complexity (Hall, 1996). Consequently, this led to a diverse array of quantitative
      simulation models that attempted to explore urban growth patterns. A drawback of these spatial models was that they
      were complicated and heavy-engineering based rather than theory, and failed to capture the urban complexity (Batty,
      1976). In the 1980s, the field of spatial modelling was revived by, amongst others, Wolfram (1984b) who showed that
      simple rules in cellular automata (CA) could replicate complex, emerging structures and patterns found in nature, and
      Couclelis (1985; 1989) who developed the first theoretical approaches for the spatial application of CA to cities.
      Subsequently, during the last three decades the field of urban modelling evolved rapidly and provided new tools to
      understand the drivers of change behind urban dynamics. For studying urban dynamics, CA has become a popular and successful
      modelling method due to its simplicity to replicate complexity. Moreover, as CA is in itself spatial and is applied
      to a grid of geographical data, it can be integrated in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to facilitate analysis,
      visualization and interpretation of the modelling results (White, Engelen, & Uljee, 1997; Itami, 1994; Batty & Xie,
      1994).

    <section id="problem-definition">
      <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
      <p>Over half of the world population lives in urbanized areas and the number of city dwellers is expected to rise in the
        coming years (UN, 2014). Generally, the Netherlands is conceived as one of the most densely urbanized areas in the
        world, and whilst this is true, Dutch cities are relatively small and urban development is dispersed (Broitman &
        Koomen, 2015). Nonetheless, as urbanization occurs, cities and villages expand outwards claiming new areas. This
        process exerts high pressure on the open and natural environment and signifies the importance of urban management
        and development. Therefore, during the last 70 years the Dutch planning concept was to anticipate urban growth and
        minimize the spatial footprint of the city and preserve the natural environment (Faludi & van der Valk, 1994; Zonneveld,
        1991). As early as 1972, the city of Groningen has attempted to deal with this urban complexity via the compact city
        policy, a policy that the city of Groningen continues to operationalize (Schroor, 2009).</p>
      <p>However, the driving forces and effects associated with urbanization affect various disciplines, and temporal and spatial
        scales, which makes understanding and describing them and their interrelations a complex issue. This knowledge is
        required to support local urban planners and decision-makers to evaluate the consequences of their planning policies
        (Koomen, Rietveld, & de Nijs, 2008). An urban model could function as a planning support system to obtain said knowledge,
        because it enables the simplification of urban complexity and allows to combine several disciplines in a multi-disciplinary
        approach (Goldstein, Candau, & Clarke, 2004). They allow the study of interaction between individual entities at
        a lower level that result in patterns at a higher level. This is useful in urban planning, where the construction
        of a society by individuals also influences the human activities of society. Through the use of simulations and scenarios,
        valuable insight into future urban dynamics could be provided to local urban planners and decision-makers.</p>

    <section id="scope-of-the-research">
      <h3>Scope of the research</h3>
      <p>This master’s thesis is an exploratory research that studies the evolution of urban growth and urban patterns of the
        Groningen region, from here on referred to as Groningen, over different time scales through computer simulations.
        It does so by applying an urban model to the Dutch context. However, it does not try to build its own urban model,
        rather, it will be using an existing model that has been frequently applied throughout the world, namely the self-modifying
        CA SLEUTH (Clarke, Hoppen, & Gaydos, 1997) and the improved version SLEUTH-3r (Jantz, Goetz, Donato, & Clagget, 2010),
        referred to as SLEUTH unless specifically discussing SLEUTH-3r. This research focusses on the core of the compact
        city policy, which is minimizing the spatial footprint of the city (Zonneveld, 1991) and urban land cover change.
        An overview of what is believed to be a relevant theoretical background with regard to CA and urban modelling will
        be presented, without explicitly attempting to expand underlying theories of complexity or urbanization. Instead,
        this study is a practical research concerned with land cover changes, with an integrated application of: GIS, remote
        sensing (RS), multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and an urban growth model (UGM). In that effort, it does not study the
        correctness of planning policies that have been applied by Groningen in the past, but it attempts to examine the
        dynamic outcomes of urbanization to support local urban planners and decision-makers. Also, it does not explicitly
        attempt to allocate urban development that could cope with future human activities or growth, since an urban model
        will only provide a rough possible indication of land cover change (Timmermans, 2003).</p>
      <p>Therefore, the scope of the research is limited to testing its hypotheses that: (a) it is possible to calibrate a UGM
        to Groningen’s context by combining separate tools (i.e. GIS, RS, MCE and UGM) and forecast future urban dynamics
        under different planning scenarios that fit into the context of Groningen, and (b) that other relevant factors that
        influence the urban development in Groningen could be incorporated in the UGM with an urbanization-suitability layer
        based on an MCE.</p>
      <p>Major advantages of the modelling and simulation approaches adopted by this research are that: the simulation will
        be based on accurate satellite imagery data by RS, which will reveal the history of urban expansion; the MCE will
        be able to include more driving forces of urban development that can be integrated into the UGM; and this type of
        modelling will help in exploring the future urban dynamics through scenarios. Drawbacks of this type of approach
        are that through the use of RS and MCE, data acquisition will be time-consuming and only a static temporal and spatial
        change between defined intervals will be recorded. This emphasizes the difficulties in conducting a temporal sensitivity
        analysis on the simulation results and the difficulties in underpinning the growth process in the study area.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="research-aims-and-objectives">
      <h3>Research aims and objectives</h3>
      <p>The aim of this master’s thesis is to contribute to the understanding of CA and urban modelling as planning support
        systems. It attempts to review relevant theories on complexity and to obtain an empirics-based understanding of said
        theory by applying a CA. Therefore, the main research objectives are:
        <ul>
          <li>calibrating and validating a UGM to suit Groningen’s context;</li>
          <li>simulating and understanding the urban growth patterns produced by the calibration phase;</li>
          <li>and predicting the future urban dynamics, spatially and temporally, using Groningen.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Accordingly, this leads to the following research question: “What will be the land cover change of Groningen in 2045
        as compared to 2015 based on three different scenarios, to explore Groningen’s future urban dynamics?”</p>
      <p>Additional research aims are to apply SLEUTH to a dispersed urban area that is relatively small with a slow absolute
        urban growth as compared to study areas SLEUTH is commonly applied to (García, Santé, Boullón, & Crecente, 2012).
        Due to the dispersed character, the area contains a variety of villages and cities of different sizes that all experienced
        different types of urban growth and show different urban patterns. In that regard, an urbanization-suitability layer
        would be key to differentiate the various types of urban growth and to capture the growth pattern with an UGM. Furthermore,
        this research assesses the feasibility of applying SLEUTH to a city with a clear spatial policy to remain compact
        and minimize urban growth. Generally, the Netherlands has a long tradition of urban planning and since the Second
        World War, urban planning has always had a strong influence on urban growth. Hence, incorporating policy maps into
        an urbanization-suitability layer may be desirable in order to accurately model historic and predict future urban
        dynamics. Although, guiding or masking the model input with policy maps into favoring more likely outcomes, could
        bias the modelling procedure in to better calibration and forecasting results (Akın, Clarke, & Berberoglu, 2014;
        Pontius, Huffaker, & Denman, 2004). This leads to the question: at what point is the model guided or biased too much
        by policies and masking? Accordingly, both additional research goals express the importance of calibrating an UGM
        to fit Groningen’s context.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="relevance">
      <h3>Relevance</h3>
      <p>The societal relevance comes from the analysis of spatial expansion patterns and land use changes that could provide
        insight into future urban dynamics of Groningen, which is of great importance for local urban planners and decision-makers.
        A CA as a planning support system is a useful tool that could visualize the historical growth patterns and alternative
        futures that are researched, which helps in exploring and understanding future urban dynamics.</p>
      <p>The scientific relevance is found in: (a) most examples found in literature apply SLEUTH to rapidly growing, large
        urban areas, where it is relatively easy to make generalizations and extrapolate processes than in slower growing
        areas (García, et al., 2012). Whilst Groningen is the second fastest growing city in the Netherlands, it is different
        from other areas that have been researched with SLEUTH, since it is a much smaller urban area and has not experienced
        same urban sprawl due to the more modest absolute growth rates and the compact city policies that have been applied
        to Groningen (Schroor, 2009). (b) Initially SLEUTH had been primarily applied to North-American cities and the application
        to cities outside of North-American was questioned. However, the last few years this has expanded rapidly to Chinese,
        Middle-Eastern and European cities. Results have shown that SLEUTH is able to identify local characteristics and
        predict future urban land change correctly across the globe (Chaudhuri & Clarke, 2013b). As local characteristics
        are often more similar in nearby regions and delineated by country borders, it would be useful to apply SLEUTH to
        the Dutch context. Consequently, this could help assess the feasibility of applying SLEUTH to the Netherlands.</p>

      <h3>Research methodology</h3>
      <p>The following section operationalizes the research statement as outlined above. This research consists of a theoretical
        approach and a practical approach (Figure 1). The theoretical approach adopts the literature review as a method to
        research Complexity Theory, urbanization and CA. The practical approach consists of a quantitative, empirical research
        using a computer simulation to gain insight in land cover changes between 2015 and 2045 based on historic data from
        1973 to 2015 for Groningen. Afterwards, the future urban dynamics are explored through scenarios. The research design
        consists of the following methods: (a) a literature research trough literature review, and (b) a case study using
        SLEUTH.
      </p>
      <p>The research methods applied in the practical approach will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 3 since the SLEUTH
        framework requires a considerable amount of pre-processing and when setting up a new application. During the practical
        research, special attention will be paid to the three phases of the modelling efforts: data acquisition, calibration
        and validation phases. Ensuring the quality of the input data is one of the most important elements of model calibration
        (Silva & Clarke, 2002). Therefore, data acquisition and data transformation are key to understanding errors and uncertainties
        in the input data and a crucial component for a successful simulation and interpretation of results (Yeh & Li, 2006).
        Similarly, the calibration phase is important, if not the most critical portion of the modelling effort. It is during
        this phase that an estimate of the parameter values, which describe an urban system, are determined, and upon which
        all forecasting and scenario simulation is based (Batty, 1976). Validation is an essential part of predictive modelling
        when models are used as planning support systems, especially since model validation is often poorly defined or even
        neglected (Pontius, et al., 2004; Pontius, Peethambaram, & Castella, 2011).</p>

      <h3>Research guide</h3>
      <p>This master’s thesis is divided into six chapters. The second chapter adopts a theoretical approach that aims at discussing
        the theoretical background of urbanization and urban modelling in an historical context. It focusses on Complexity
        Theory and various related theories such as: urbanization, the evolutionary paradigm, the General System Theory,
        emergence, Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. All of these theories include some of the most important characteristics
        that lay the foundations of Complexity Theory and CA. From there on, more is explained on the origin and general
        structure of spatial models and in particular CA. The next section provides an overview and brief explanation of
        spatial models that are currently available and commonly used for the simulation of urban dynamics. Lastly, the chapter
        end with concluding notes and explaining why SLEUTH was chosen for this study.</p>
      <p>The third chapter will explain the research methodology in more detail. Initially, the delineation of the study area
        is shown and a brief historic overview of the study area is given. Afterwards, methods used in this study are discussed
        as well as the various scales that they are applied to. The next section of the chapter focus on the calibration,
        based on a SLEUTH-specific calibration procedure. The subsequent validation of SLEUTH is discussed in the following
        section. Both are discussed in detail, emphasizing the fact that these two processes are crucial to a successful
        modelling result and to properly define them as two separate phases during urban modelling. The next section explains
        the prediction procedure as conducted in this study and the three scenarios that were used in prediction. Lastly,
        the chapter end with concluding notes and a brief overview of the third chapter.</p>
      <p>The following chapter elaborates on the data pre-processing that was done during this study. This includes the pre-processing
        of satellite data via RS, the input data for SLEUTH and the various input layers that were needed for an urbanization-suitability
        layer based on an MCE, to implement in the excluded layer of SLEUTH. The chapter focusses on explaining how the input
        data was pre-processed and why certain decisions were made, in order to determine the accuracy of the input data,
        so the subsequent validation could properly assess the accuracy of the modelling results.</p>
      <p>The fifth chapter will present the calibration, validation and prediction results based on the application of SLEUTH.
        Lastly, the final chapter will discuss the conclusion based on the whole research and specifically the application
        of SLEUTH to Groningen.</p>

        <h3>Complexity Theory</h3>
        <p>CA has become a popular modelling method to understand urban land use change due to its simplicity to replicate emerging
          and complex patterns. To give meaning to the term CA, the underlying principle of complexity will be discussed.
          Complexity is a theory that consists of diverse concepts reaching all the way back to the 19th century. Therefore,
          some relevant concepts and theories will be elaborated: urbanización, the evolutionary paradigm, the General Systems
          Theory, emergence, Chaos Theory and fractal geometry. The theories and paradigms that will be briefly discussed
          are merely a portion of the literature that is the basis of Complexity Theory. However, these function as a scope
          to view Complexity Theory to provide some insight in the origins of CA.</p>

          <h4>Urbanización</h4>
          <p>The concentration of population in urban areas and the subsequent urban growth are world-wide phenomena. These
            phenomena have its origins in a time in transition: a transition from a rural to urban society, driven by the
            industrial revolution. The zeitgeist of this period is portrayed by on one side the fascination of the metropolitan
            society as described by Simmel (1903). To him the city was an opportunity, one filled with uncertainty, marking
            the schism between a rural and urban society. It was a place producing conditions that liberated the metropolitan
            man, as well as overstimulate his senses. This was unfathomable to those living in the country and is what separated
            the city dweller from his fellow man (Simmel, 1903). The city was a place of luxury, watching and being watched,
            with a distant yet intensely social-cultural atmosphere (Benjamin, 1935).</p>
          <p>On the other side there was the rejection of the metropolis, a grim image of the sporadically ever-growing “monster
            Leviathan, stretching acre upon acre into the far distance”, as Wright (1901) so eloquently phrased in his piece:
            “The Art and Craft of the Machine”. “Be gently lifted at nightfall to the top of a great down-town office building,
            and you may see how in the image of material man, at once his glory and menace, is this thing we call a city”
            (p. 68). This rejection of the city led to the ‘Garden City’ concept by Howard (1902), who showed a similar distaste
            of the city. “I am always haunted by the awfulness of London: by the great appalling fact of these millions cast
            down, as it would appear by hazard, on the banks of this noble stream, working each in their own groove and their
            own cell, without regard or knowledge of each other” (p. 10). Both Howard and Wright were concerned with the
            well-being of the city dwellers and saw the negative social and health effects cities had on its inhabitants
            that were most acute in large cities. Therefore, both developed their utopian antithesis of the industrial city,
            their antidote to the greatest danger of modern existence.</p>
          <p>The idea that urban growth was a monstrous, uncontrollable growth dominated the origins of urban planning. The
            growth and various problems a city produced were considered a problem that could be, and should be, controlled
            via planning and policies. This kind of approach has its roots in physicalism, a concept that is based on the
            idea that urban problems could be solved, and the behavior of the masses could be controlled by shaping the physical
            urban environment (Batty & Marshall, 2009).</p>
          <p>Ever since the 19th century, as a reaction to the urban chaos unraveled by the industrial revolution, centralized
            planning and policies were seen as the solution to controlling the effects caused by urban growth. Exemplar to
            the paradigm of physicalism were Haussmann and Cerdá, who both lived in an era where it became important to perform
            some sort of control over the rapidly growing industrial cities. Between 1852 and 1870, Haussmann was one of
            the first to attempt this on a large scale by modernizing Paris. His goal was to solve the problems of overcrowding,
            crime, traffic circulation and the spreading of diseases. He attempted to do this by controlling the city via
            creating a whole circulatory and respiratory system that would turn the city into an operative whole. Similarly,
            in 1860 Cerdá attempted to improve the living conditions and infrastructural circulation in Barcelona via his
            top-down urban expansion plans. However, as urban areas are structures of great complexity, the effects of policies
            and urban plans regularly had unforeseen consequences. Controlling the city, its effects, problems and inhabitants
            was not that straightforward.</p>
          <p>In the 19th century, with the advances of modern civilization, Cerdá predicted that the construction of cities
            would become a true science. He foresaw the coming of the new science of urbanism and developed the concept of
            <em>urbanización</em> in ‘Teoría General de la Urbanización’ in 1876. He understood that the industrial revolution
            and “the harnessing of steam as a driving force had signaled the end of an era for humanity and the beginning
            of another” (Soria y Puig, 1999, p. 54). With the birth of new infrastructures such as telecommunications, sewage
            systems and railroads, he foresaw a civilization of movement and communication. A dynamic place where time is
            counted in seconds and distance in myriametres (i.e. 10 kilometers). He developed an integrated approach to urbanism
            as “today everything is movement, everything is expansion, everything is communicativeness” (Soria y Puig, 1999,
            p. 57) and proposed a radical theory that the infrastructure and especially the <em>circulacíon</em>, were fundamental
            to urbanization. Prior to Cerdá circulation, was used as an analytical framework to do calculations and explain
            or describe the current state. However, Cerdá envisioned circulacíon being the theoretical grounds on which the
            current state could be transformed in service of a mobile and alterable urban area and society (Adams, 2014).</p>
          <p>“Today, everything that matters circulates. Circulation is the central activity through which value is made visible.
            It is the concrete register of progress. For this reason, infrastructure now appears as the default apparatus
            by which such a global society mediates its needs. It is the source of our problems as well as the diagram for
            their solutions” (Adams, 2014, p.13).</p>
          <p>The question now was, what should Cerdá name this dynamic place? He introduced a new word: <em>urbe</em>. A term
            closely related to ‘city’, but as Cerdá explains: the difference being that the urban area (urbe) presupposes
            the city, it disregards the administrative boundaries that confine a city (<em>ciudad</em>). The urbe included
            townships and hamlets in the periphery, the towns and villages closer to the center, and in the very center,
            the urban core. These three things, distinct from each other, genuinely form what should be called an urbe (Soria
            y Puig, 1999). With the term urbe, Cerdá wanted to address the dynamic character of the urban area wherein infrastructure
            is the physical appearance of circulation, unbounded by borders. It allowed circulation to flow unobstructed
            and glue all facets and nodes of the urban area together. Cerdá named this infrastructure: <em>vialidad</em>.
            With this theory he recognized the urbe, with the fundaments of vialadid and circulacíon, as a complex process
            relying on five bases: technical, political, economic, legal and administrative. These bases were interrelated
            and to understand them, one would have to study circulacíon, vialidad and the urbe with statistical studies,
            what Cerdá called an “encyclopedic approach”. Subsequently, bearing all five bases in mind whilst developing
            an expansion plan for an urbe would yield the highest result, a harmony between “the independence of the family
            and the enjoyment of sociability” (Soria y Puig, 1999, pp. 64-66).</p>
          <section id="evolutionary-paradigm">
            <h4>Evolutionary Paradigm</h4>
            <p>During that same period, the image of the city as a machine was replaced by that of an organism. The city was
              often analogous to an organism, such as Howard (1902), who compared settlements to organisms and Burgess (1924),
              who compared urban growth to the anabolic and catabolic states of the metabolism. Both these analogues have
              their roots in the evolutionary paradigm, which was underpinned by the work of Geddes (1915). He conceived
              the city as something organic that would evolve in relation to its environment. “The environment acts, through
              function, upon the organism and conversely the organism acts, through function, upon the environment” and the
              “…environment, function and organism are thus no longer viewed apart, but as the elements of a single process…”
              (Geddes, 1915, p. 198). His work drew loosely upon the Theory of Evolution by Darwin, but emphasized the importance
              of the cooperation of the individual cells to survive competition. His comparison to evolution implied there
              is a fixed relation between the parts and the whole of the organism, but since evolution is open-ended and
              unpredictable, cities would not have an end-state. This is in contrast to traditional city planners such as
              Haussmann and Cerdá, who endeavored the optima forma of cities by the implementation of their plans.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Geddes speaks of Greater London that is exceeding its physical boundaries and is uniting neighboring
              villages and cities. He states that the governmental and administrative boundaries are constantly being outgrown.
              This growth process demanded a new civic statesmanship. “Constellations we cannot call them; conglomerations
              is, alas! nearer the mark at present, but it may sound unappreciative; what of Conurbations?” (Geddes, 1915,
              p. 34). Geddes envisioned a city-region that would function as a whole, an organism flourishing through cooperation,
              thus the city would only be as good as its city-region. A few decades earlier, that same point was made by
              Cerdá, when he coined the term urbe. Nonetheless, the term conurbation was picked up by Fawcett (1922) and
              officially adopted by the United Kingdom. Fawcett changed the definition of the term conurbation slightly,
              to an area occupied by a continuous series of dwellings, factories and other buildings, which are not separated
              from each other by rural land, or what he called the “brick-and-mortar unity”. However, it is important to
              note that both authors saw the region strictly as a physical phenomenon (Hall, 1996).</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Geddes’ ideas of the evolutionary paradigm were to some extent misinterpreted. For example, Mumford
              (1938) tried to extend the organic analogue by arguing that since organisms have a definite boundary and maximum
              size, so should a city. “Like an organism, cities much achieve stability and continuity …if they are to perform
              their high function as the cradle and focus of man’s creative activities” (Chapman & Fenyon, 1963). Subsequently,
              the concentration of activity would undermine its benefits, leading to a formless urban tissue spreading randomly
              across the countryside, bringing chaos and congestion. Instead, he emphasized stability. Therefore, the limitations
              on size, density and area were necessary and the most important instruments of civic planning. Cities would
              have to be understood as a city-region, wherein the city could only thrive if all parts would cooperate (Mumford,
              1938). This kind of thinking fell in line with the traditional top-down planning approach, wherein the planner
              knew the intended optima forma of a city and could apply this via his designs.</p>
            <p>There was a view that Geddes shared with Cerdá, which was the statistical vision they had of the city. The both
              believed one would have to understand and diagnose the urban landscape through statistical studies before attempting
              to treat its problems, “survey before plan” (Geddes, 1915). Conversely, Sitte (1889) spoke out against this
              statistical view of the city and pleaded for city planning according to artistic principles. “To approach everything
              in a strictly methodical manner and not to waver a hair’s breadth from preconceived patterns, until genius
              has been strangled to death and joie de vivre stifled by the system, that is the sign of our time” (p. 229).
              Sitte criticized modern planning and emphasized the need to examine the building units that composed a city,
              as opposed to examining the whole sanitary drainage or the traffic flows as Haussmann and Cerdá did. He was
              inspired by old Roman and Greek streets and plazas, the building units, that adapted to local conditions and
              “developed gradually in natura” (pp. 187-188). He emphasized on the coherent organism of the town achieved
              through proper correlation of the building units. However, Sitte did not drew an analogue to an organism in
              the same manner as Howard or Geddes, as his perspective was different. Instead, he was referring to organic
              consistency of a city due to proper correlation of its building units.</p>
